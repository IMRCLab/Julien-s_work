# Julien-s_work
This repository documents the different projects I worked on for IMRC so that the next student assistants can easily continue my projects


I have worked mainly on four things : 
1) System tests : a series of script to automatically fly and evaluate the proper functionning of crazyflies in crazyswarm2
2) Pololu 3pI+ ground robot : first prototype of the controler + state estimator to guide the 3pi+ robot. Also designed and 3d printed a small platform to fix the nrf radio dongle and a stick (for Akmaral)
3) infinite flight : using the induction charger to make the crazyflie fly continuously as long as possible
4) Bolt and compute module 4 : a Bitcraze prototype drone on which we manted to mount the Ras-Pi compute module 4. This project came to a halt because of parts never arriving and techincal difficulties between CM4 and camera. 

NB : for detailed explanations and code files on the 3pi+ project, see https://github.com/IMRCLab/Pololu_3pi-
